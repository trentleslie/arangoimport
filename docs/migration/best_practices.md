# Migration Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for migrating data to ArangoDB using the ArangoImport tool.

## Planning Your Migration

### 1. Analyze Source Data

Before starting the migration:
- Understand the data model and relationships in your source database
- Identify any special data types or structures that may need special handling
- Estimate the size of your data to plan for resource requirements
- Check for data quality issues (missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates)

### 2. Define Your ArangoDB Data Model

- Decide on your collection structure (nodes, edges, and other collections)
- Plan your indexing strategy to optimize query performance
- Consider if you need to split data across multiple collections based on type
- Determine your key generation strategy for nodes and edges

### 3. Test with a Subset

Before migrating your entire dataset:
- Export and import a small, representative subset
- Validate that data relationships are preserved
- Verify that queries return expected results
- Measure performance to estimate full migration time

## Optimization Strategies

### Improving Import Performance

1. **Parallelization**:
   - Use multiple worker processes (`--processes` option)
   - Adjust based on the number of available CPU cores
   - For very large datasets, consider distributing the import across multiple machines

2. **Batch Size Optimization**:
   - The default batch size is 1,000 documents
   - For smaller documents, increase the batch size (e.g., 5,000-10,000)
   - For larger documents, decrease the batch size
   - Monitor memory usage and adjust accordingly

3. **Network and Hardware Considerations**:
   - Run the import process on the same machine as ArangoDB when possible
   - Ensure sufficient RAM for both ArangoDB and the import process
   - Use SSD storage for better performance
   - Consider network bandwidth if importing remotely

### Reducing Memory Usage

1. **Streaming Import**:
   - ArangoImport processes data in a streaming fashion to minimize memory footprint
   - For very large files, consider splitting into smaller chunks

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Monitor memory usage during import
   - Adjust the number of worker processes if memory pressure is high
   - Consider increasing swap space for large imports on memory-constrained systems

## Data Validation and Integrity

### Pre-Import Validation

- Validate your data format before import
- Check for required fields and data types
- Verify that all edge references point to valid nodes
- Handle or remove problematic records

### Post-Import Verification

- Count nodes and edges to verify all data was imported
- Sample records to confirm data integrity
- Run test queries to validate relationships and data access patterns
- Check for any orphaned edges (those with invalid references)

## Managing Duplicate Data

### Node Deduplication

- Use unique identifiers from the source system as keys
- Consider creating compound keys for nodes without unique identifiers
- Use the `on_duplicate` option to control how duplicates are handled

### Edge Deduplication

- Generate edge keys that incorporate source node, target node, and relationship type
- Use batch processing to detect potential duplicates
- Set appropriate `on_duplicate` policy for edges (usually `ignore`)

## Logging and Monitoring

### Effective Logging Practices

- Use the `--log-level` option to control verbosity
- For production imports, use `WARNING` level to reduce output
- For debugging, use `INFO` or `DEBUG` levels
- Redirect output to a file for later analysis: `> import_log.txt 2>&1`

### Progress Monitoring

- Monitor the progress of long-running imports
- Use database queries to check progress of node and edge imports
- Set up monitoring for server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O)

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Dealing with Import Failures

- Import errors are logged with context information
- For transient errors, retry the import with the same parameters
- For data-related errors, fix the source data and retry

### Resumable Imports

- If an import fails partway through, you may need to:
  1. Drop the partially imported collections
  2. Fix the issue that caused the failure
  3. Restart the import
- For very large datasets, consider implementing a checkpoint system

## Security Considerations

### Credentials Management

- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Consider using connection strings or configuration files instead of command-line parameters
- Follow the principle of least privilege for database accounts

### Network Security

- Use SSL/TLS for connections to remote ArangoDB instances
- Consider using SSH tunnels for additional security
- Limit access to the import process to authorized users

## Example: Multi-Phase Migration

For very large datasets, consider a multi-phase approach:

1. **Import Critical Nodes**: Import the most important node types first
2. **Import Relationships**: Add edges between critical nodes
3. **Import Secondary Nodes**: Add less critical node types
4. **Complete Relationships**: Add remaining edges
5. **Validation**: Verify data integrity across all phases
