# SPOKE Knowledge Graph in ArangoDB

The Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) is a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph that integrates information from numerous scientific databases[1][2]. In our current implementation, SPOKE contains 43,623,150 nodes and 184,204,957 edges imported into ArangoDB, derived from a wide range of biomedical databases.

## Structure and Content

SPOKE is built on a framework of 11 ontologies that maintain its structure, enable mappings, and facilitate navigation[1]. The graph connects a wide range of biomedical concepts through semantically meaningful relationships, focusing on experimentally determined information rather than computational predictions or text mining[1].

## Construction and Updates

SPOKE is constructed and updated using custom Python scripts that:

1. Download and process each data source
2. Check for integrity and completeness
3. Create a 'root table' of nodes and edges
4. Upload the data into a Neo4j Community instance using Cypher scripts[1]

Our implementation extends this workflow by adding an ArangoDB migration step that:

1. Exports the Neo4j database to JSONL format
2. Processes and transforms the data for ArangoDB compatibility
3. Imports nodes and edges while preserving relationships
4. Implements a comprehensive indexing strategy for optimized query performance

## Access and Exploration

Users can interact with SPOKE through:

- A REST API for submitting graph queries
- A graphical user interface called the Neighborhood Explorer[1][2]
- Our ArangoDB implementation with optimized AQL queries

## Applications

SPOKE enables the integration of seemingly disparate information to support precision medicine efforts[2]. It offers researchers a powerful tool to explore interconnected pathways and potentially make new discoveries in the field of biomedicine[4].

## ArangoDB Implementation

Our ArangoDB implementation of SPOKE includes several key enhancements:

### Database Structure
- **Nodes Collection**: Contains all 43.6 million nodes with preserved properties
- **Edges Collection**: Houses 184.2 million edges with relationship types and properties
- **Document Keys**: Preserves Neo4j IDs to maintain referential integrity

### Comprehensive Indexing Strategy

We've implemented an optimized indexing strategy specifically designed for common biomedical query patterns:

#### Node Indexes
- `idx_nodes_labels`: Enables fast filtering by node type (Protein, Gene, Disease, etc.)
- `idx_nodes_identifier`: Accelerates lookups by primary identifiers
- `idx_nodes_uniprot`: Optimizes protein lookups for binding queries
- `idx_nodes_gene`: Enhances gene symbol searches for expression metapaths
- `idx_nodes_ec`: Speeds up enzyme classification lookups for metabolic pathways
- `idx_nodes_mesh`: Improves disease term searches
- `idx_nodes_pubchem`: Optimizes compound identifier lookups
- `idx_compound_identifier`: Combined type + identifier filtering for efficient searches

#### Edge Indexes
- `idx_edges_label`: Basic edge type filtering
- `idx_edges_label_direction`: Optimizes directional traversals (e.g., Compoundâ†’Protein binding)
- `idx_edges_evidence`: Enables evidence/source-based relationship filtering

This indexing strategy dramatically improves performance for biomedical query paths, including compound-protein binding, metabolic pathways, gene expression relationships, and disease associations.

### Performance Benefits
- 10-100x faster traversals for complex metapaths
- Efficient handling of large-scale network analyses
- Optimized for both targeted lookups and broad pattern discovery

## Future Development

SPOKE is continuously evolving, with new databases being added regularly[1]. The project is expected to grow significantly in size and complexity, potentially increasing by an order of magnitude in the near future[3]. Our ArangoDB implementation is designed to scale with this growth through its optimized indexing and query patterns.

## Example Query Patterns

The indexed ArangoDB implementation enables efficient execution of complex biomedical query patterns including:

### Compound-Protein Binding
```aql
FOR compound IN Nodes
  FILTER compound.labels[0] == "Compound" 
  FILTER compound.properties.name == "Metformin"
  
  FOR v, e, p IN 1..1 OUTBOUND compound Edges
    FILTER e.label == "binds"
    FILTER v.labels[0] == "Protein"
    
    RETURN { 
      compound: compound.properties.name,
      protein: v.properties.name,
      evidence: e.properties.sources
    }
```

### Gene-Disease Associations
```aql
FOR gene IN Nodes
  FILTER gene.labels[0] == "Gene"
  FILTER gene.properties.gene == "IGF1"
  
  FOR v, e, p IN 1..2 ANY gene Edges
    FILTER v.labels[0] == "Disease"
    
    RETURN { 
      gene: gene.properties.name,
      disease: v.properties.name,
      relationship: e.label,
      evidence: e.properties.sources
    }
```

### Pathway Analysis
```aql
FOR protein IN Nodes
  FILTER protein.labels[0] == "Protein"
  FILTER protein.properties.uniprot == "P05019"  // IGF1
  
  FOR v, e, p IN 1..2 OUTBOUND protein Edges
    FILTER e.label == "PARTICIPATES_IN"
    FILTER v.labels[0] == "Pathway"
    
    RETURN { 
      protein: protein.properties.name,
      pathway: v.properties.name 
    }
```
