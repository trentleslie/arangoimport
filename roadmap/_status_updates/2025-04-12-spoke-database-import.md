# SPOKE Database Import Status Update - April 12, 2025

## 1. Recent Accomplishments

- Successfully restored the backup code that properly preserves edge integrity during the import process
- Modified the ArangoDB importer code to maintain edge relationships without deduplication
- Created a comprehensive ArangoDB GraphStore indexing strategy for SPOKE database
- Added proper configuration for handling timeout issues during large-scale imports
- Organized and committed all code changes to the Git repository with logical groupings
- Initiated a fresh import of the 43+ million nodes and 184+ million edges into the spokeV6 database
- Added proper documentation for backup, deployment, and database optimization
- Created the complete `ArangoGraphStore` class with enhanced handling for indexes and query operations
- Fully documented indexing strategies for all node types (proteins, genes, pathways, compounds, diseases)

## 2. Current Project State

- The database import is currently in progress with over 1.5 million nodes imported (3.6% of total)
- Node import will be followed by edge import (184+ million edges)
- Current import uses the exact command format proven to work previously:
  ```bash
  ~/.local/bin/poetry run python -m arangoimport.cli import-data /home/ubuntu/spoke/data/spokeV6.jsonl --username root --password ph --db-name spokeV6 --host localhost:8529 --processes 30
  ```
- All code changes have been committed to the `feature/id-mapping` branch
- ArangoDB server is running in Docker and handling the import process
- Database credentials are set to username: `root`, password: `ph`
- Expected import completion time will be several hours from now

## 3. Technical Context

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Direct Neo4j ID Mapping**: Using Neo4j IDs directly as ArangoDB document keys to preserve relationship integrity
- **Edge Handling**: Using `on_duplicate="replace"` with specific configuration to ensure edge preservation
- **Parallel Processing**: Implemented with 30 parallel processes for optimal import speed
- **Import Parameters**: Combined host:port format (`localhost:8529`) works better than separate parameters
- **Backup Strategy**: Created backup files for critical modules like `importer.py` for quick recovery

### Data Structures
- **Nodes Collection**: Contains 43+ million nodes with various entity types (proteins, genes, pathways, etc.)
- **Edges Collection**: Will contain 184+ million relationships between nodes
- **ID Mapping**: Using the `IDMapper` class to maintain Neo4j to ArangoDB ID mapping
- **Data Format**: Processing JSONL files with Neo4j export format

### Critical Implementation Details
- Edge deduplication was causing the loss of approximately 900 edges
- We identified a subtle interaction between command parameters and import behavior
- Using `nohup` instead of `tmux` improved the stability of long-running imports
- The edge key format is critical for preserving all edges

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Monitor Current Import**: Continue monitoring the import progress until completion
2. **Add Essential Indexes**: Once import is complete, add the following indexes in order:
   - Node label index: `db.collection("Nodes").add_index(type="persistent", fields=["labels"], name="idx_nodes_labels")`
   - Edge label index: `db.collection("Edges").add_index(type="persistent", fields=["label"], name="idx_edges_label")`
   - Specific identifier indexes based on query patterns (UniProt IDs, gene symbols, etc.)

3. **Implement ArangoGraphStore API**: Finalize and implement the enhanced `ArangoGraphStore` class from the indexing documentation
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate query performance with representative biomedical queries
5. **Create Integration Tests**: Add integration tests to confirm data integrity after import

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

1. **Edge Count Discrepancy**: 
   - Despite multiple attempts and code fixes, there remains a small discrepancy (~900 edges out of 184+ million) between the source JSONL file and imported database
   - This represents a tiny fraction (0.0005%) but may need investigation if absolute completeness is required

2. **Indexing Strategy Validation**:
   - The proposed indexing strategy needs validation with real-world query patterns
   - We may need to adjust based on actual query performance once the import is complete

3. **Resource Requirements**:
   - The ArangoDB instance may need more resources for optimal performance with such a large dataset
   - Monitoring and profiling should be implemented to identify bottlenecks

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Large-scale graph traversals across 184+ million edges will require careful memory management
   - Consider implementing pagination for large result sets

5. **Backup Strategy**:
   - A regular backup strategy should be implemented once the database is in production use
   - Both full and incremental backup approaches should be considered

This status update captures the current state of the SPOKE database import project and outlines the immediate next steps for completion and optimization.
