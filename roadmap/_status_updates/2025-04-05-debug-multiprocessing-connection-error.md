# Project Status Update: ArangoDB Importer Multi-Processing Debugging

**Date:** 2025-04-05

## 1. Project Goal
The primary goal is to enable reliable and efficient parallel data import (`--processes > 1`) into ArangoDB using the `arangoimport` tool, specifically focusing on resolving the hanging issue observed with multiple processes. A secondary goal is to ensure data integrity (no duplicates) and maintain clean, informative logging.

## 2. Progress Update
- **Single-Process Success:** Successfully imported the `igf1_subgraph.jsonl` test file using a single process (`--processes 1`).
- **Data Verification:** Confirmed via AQL query that no duplicate edges were created during the single-process import.
- **Logging Cleanup:** Removed excessive debug logging related to batch saving (`logger.critical` call in `batch_save_documents`).
- **Multi-Process Debug Logging:** Added detailed logging (process IDs, timestamps, chunk info, join status) to `parallel_load_data` and `process_chunk` functions in `src/arangoimport/importer.py` to help diagnose the multi-processing hang.
- **Error Resolution:** Identified and fixed several issues encountered while attempting to run the multi-process import:
    - `poetry: command not found` -> Used full path `~/.local/bin/poetry`.
    - `ImportError: attempted relative import` -> Used `python -m arangoimport.cli`.
    - `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block` -> Corrected indentation and try/except structure in node batch processing loop (around line 856 in `importer.py`).
    - Incorrect CLI options (`--file` instead of positional, `--db` instead of `--db-name`).
    - Incorrect input file path (`/home/ubuntu/spoke/arangoimport/...` instead of `/home/ubuntu/spoke/data/...`).
- **Current Blocker:** Hitting a connection error (`Failed to parse: http://localhost:8529:8529/_db/_system/_api/database`). The ArangoDB host URL appears to be malformed with a duplicated port number.

## 3. Key Decisions & Design Choices
- **Debugging Approach:** Adopted a strategy of adding detailed logging to pinpoint failures within the parallel processing logic (`parallel_load_data` and `process_chunk`).
- **Error Focus:** The current priority is fixing the ArangoDB connection URL formation, as this prevents any multi-process testing.
- **Likely Root Cause:** The malformed URL strongly suggests an issue in how the host and port are combined, likely within the `ArangoConnection.__init__` method in `src/arangoimport/connection.py` (specifically line 119: `self.client = ArangoClient(hosts=f"http://{self.host}:{self.port}")`).

## 4. Next Steps
- **Immediate Task:** Investigate and fix the URL construction logic in `src/arangoimport/connection.py` to prevent the duplicated port number.
- **Test Multi-Processing:** Re-run the import command with the corrected connection logic and `--processes 4`:
  ```bash
  ~/.local/bin/poetry run python -m arangoimport.cli import-data /home/ubuntu/spoke/data/igf1_subgraph.jsonl --username root --db-name spokeV6 --host localhost:8529 --processes 4
  ```
- **Analyze Logs:** If the import runs (or hangs again), analyze the detailed logs generated by the workers and the main process to identify the cause of the original hanging behavior or any new issues.
- **Address Hangs:** Based on log analysis, implement further fixes targeting potential deadlocks, resource contention, or unhandled errors in worker processes (potentially related to `IDMapper` or database interactions).

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations
- **`IDMapper` Robustness:** If connection issues are fixed but hangs persist, the synchronization logic within `IDMapper` (used for coordinating node IDs between processes before edge import) might need closer examination.
- **Resource Contention:** Are there other potential bottlenecks like database write locks or disk I/O limitations that become apparent only under parallel load?
